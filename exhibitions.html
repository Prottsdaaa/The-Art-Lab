     <h3><u>ANITA DUBE: THE DEVIL IN THE DETAIL</u></h3>
     <h5>27 September-27 October</h5>
     <p style="font-size: larger;">Delhi-based artist Anita Dube’s oeuvre follows the corporeality of our individual and collective bodies, <br>encapsulated in language, memory, history and mythology, by exploring the body as material and consequence, as possession and agent. Her well-regarded use of ceramic votive eyes, otherwise appearing in religious effigies, seek to resist the commodification of images and language, <br>even or especially when accessed through social and political engagement, resulting in a kind of compassion fatigue. Featuring a series of paintings, photographs and sculptures, The Devil in the Detail leverages Dube’s art historical relationship with text as an embodiment of a contemporary pulse, <br>inviting viewers to traverse through the over-amplification and noise of desensitized meanings in speaking truth to power with a fresh perspective, especially considering recent events in post-colonial India, which has seen a rise in resistance by different interest groups.

     <h3><u>JUUL KRAIJER: ON WINGS</u></h3>
     <h5>27 September-27 October 2023</h5>
     <p style="font-size: larger;">Dutch artist Juul Kraijer’s images seek to upturn our daily logic and rationality in favour of the incredulity and wonder of a world held beyond belief. She documents staged interactions between a model, often presented androgynously, and other sentient beings like birds and butterflies that appear in possession of their own consciousness and deportment. By juxtaposing their bodies in an unbounded encounter, Kraijer incites the primal reactions of bewilderment, awe and even fear in the vein of subliminal provocations explored by the Romantics in the nineteenth century especially in dealing with “things of beauty”,<br> often explored as a nostalgic return to nature and natural elements. Her emphasis on the intensity of our emotional registers is enhanced by the tension between fear and fascination, alerting us to the intricacies and contradictions that make-up our individual experiences to collective or shared events exploring the interiority of the self as an embodiment of our physical forms and contours. <br>On Wings features a suite of photographs, collages, drawings and a video work.</p>
